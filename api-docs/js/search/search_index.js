  Partition a query parameter into multiple others.\nPartitioning is useful if you need to bind a single form control to multiple query parameters.\nFor example, consider a {@code } which represents both a field to sort by and the\ndirection to sort in. If you want to encode these two information on separate URL parameters,\nyou can define a single query parameter that is partitioned into two others.\n\n\n                    \n
